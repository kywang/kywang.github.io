I am an associate professor in [CSSE](https://www.concordia.ca/ginacody/computer-science-software-eng.html) at [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/) since 2022. Before joining Concordia, I was an assistant (then associate) professor at the [University of Manitoba](https://sci.umanitoba.ca/cs/) during 2012-2022. During 2020-2022, I took a leave from UManitoba and worked full-time at [Huawei Canada](https://www.huawei.com/ca/) as the chief scientist in computer vision (technical VP) in the [Consumer Business Group](https://consumer.huawei.com/ca/). Before UManitoba, I worked as an NSERC postdoc at [UIUC](https://cs.illinois.edu/). I received my PhD from [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/computing.html), MSc from [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/index.html), and BEng from [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://en.hit.edu.cn/). My group works on a variety of topics in computer vision, machine learning, deep learning. The work from our group has been recognized by [Falconer Emerging Researcher Rh Award](http://news.umanitoba.ca/bush-ethics-decolonizing-the-university/) in applied science (2017), [Faculty of Science research chair](http://www.sci.umanitoba.ca/news/new-research-chairs-in-fundamental-science-2/) in fundamental science at UManitoba (2019-2022), winning team at [ORBIT few-shot object recognition challenge](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/1438/overview) (see presentation at [CVPR2022 VisWiz workshop](https://vizwiz.org/workshops/2022-workshop/)). I am fortunate to have worked with many [excellent students](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd-YfB11_dE) over the years.

Some of my recent research focuses on building AI models beyond the "brute-force" supervised approach. The ultimate goal is to allow the AI models to be personalized, flexible, and easily adaptable to different scenarios with minimal efforts (see [this talk]() for an overview). We have developed variants of machine learning algorithms such as meta learning, test-time training, continual learning in this direction. We have used these techniques in various computer vision tasks, such as crowd counting, anomaly detection, video highlight, image deblurring, point cloud analysis, gaze estimation, etc.

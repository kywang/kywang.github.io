I am currently serving as the COMP undergraduate program director (UGPD). Please use the email "ugpd-compsci at concordia dot ca" instead of my regular email for COMP UGPD matters. Note that if you are in the SOEN program, you should contact the SOEN undergraduate program director instead.

If you are contacting me as a prospective graduate student, please refer to this page before contacting me.
